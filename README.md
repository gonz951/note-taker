## Description

The note taker application was made to experiment with express.js. The challenge, for the most part, was simply getting the routes set up. The application itself was made for easier note-taking, due to the simple nature of the program.

Running it on render makes it more convenient to use, but here is a step by step guide on how the application works there.

Once the link is opened, you'll find yourself on the starting page. Just click the 'get started' button to go to the main page.

Here is the main page. Here you will make notes, save them, delete them, etc.
To make a note, simply add a title and some note content, and the 'save note' button should appear. Click it, and it'll show up in the sidebar.

If you want to delete a note, just hit the trash can button, and it will be deleted from the database file holding the information.
